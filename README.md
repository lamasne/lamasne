Hi,

I am a PhD candidate at ICMAB, Barcelona. 

My thesis is about the application of superconductor tapes to high energy applications (e.g. FCC-hh, axion detectors, application to nuclear fusion).

Apart from that, I am also working on personal projects such as a language learning app. 

Cheers,

Neil
