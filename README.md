Hi,

I'm Neil, an engineer by training (specialized in nuclear fusion). I worked for a year as a software engineer and recently completed a PhD in Physics (superconductors) at ICMAB-CSIC, Barcelona, collaborating with CERN, the Max Planck Institute, and the Stanford Linear Accelerator.

I have a strong passion for programming, particularly in developing custom AI models for scientific discovery and computer vision. My larger projects remain private to protect their potential business value.

I am currently looking for opportunities that combine mathematics and programming, preferably in areas that benefit society, such as computer vision in healthcare, robotics applications, or quantitative finance.

Enjoy exploring my GitHub!

Neil
